  "SUMMARY": "Library for manipulating C and Unicode strings",
  "DESCRIPTION": "Text files are nowadays usually encoded in Unicode, and may\u001b consist of very different scripts from Latin letters to Chinese Hanzi\u001b with many kinds of special characters accents, right-to-left writing\u001b marks, hyphens, Roman numbers, and much more. But the POSIX platform\u001b APIs for text do not contain adequate functions for dealing with\u001b particular properties of many Unicode characters. In fact, the POSIX\u001b APIs for text have several assumptions at their base which don't hold\u001b for Unicode text.  This library provides functions for manipulating\u001b Unicode strings and for manipulating C strings according to the Unicode\u001b standard.  This package contains documentation.",
