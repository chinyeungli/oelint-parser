  "SUMMARY": "Library of utility functions from BSD systems",
  "DESCRIPTION": "This library provides useful functions commonly found on BSD systems, \u001b               and lacking on others like GNU systems, thus making it easier to port \u001b               projects with strong BSD origins, without needing to embed the same \u001b               code over and over again on each project.",
