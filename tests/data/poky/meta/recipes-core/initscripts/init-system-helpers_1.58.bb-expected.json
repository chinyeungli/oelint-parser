  "SUMMARY": "helper tools for all init systems",
  "DESCRIPTION": "This package contains helper tools that are necessary for switching between \u001bthe various init systems that Debian contains (e. g. sysvinit or \u001bsystemd). An example is deb-systemd-helper, a script that enables systemd unit \u001bfiles without depending on a running systemd. \u001b\u001bIt also includes the \u001b\"service\u001b\", \u001b\"invoke-rc.d\u001b\", and \u001b\"update-rc.d\u001b\" scripts which \u001bprovide an abstraction for enabling, disabling, starting, and stopping \u001bservices for all supported Debian init systems as specified by the policy. \u001b\u001bWhile this package is maintained by pkg-systemd-maintainers, it is NOT \u001bspecific to systemd at all. Maintainers of other init systems are welcome to \u001binclude their helpers in this package.",
