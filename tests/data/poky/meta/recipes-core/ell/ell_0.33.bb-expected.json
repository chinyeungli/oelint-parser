  "SUMMARY": "Embedded Linux Library",
  "DESCRIPTION": "The Embedded Linux Library (ELL) provides core, \u001blow-level functionality for system daemons. It typically has no \u001bdependencies other than the Linux kernel, C standard library, and \u001blibdl (for dynamic linking). While ELL is designed to be efficient \u001band compact enough for use on embedded Linux platforms, it is not \u001blimited to resource-constrained systems.",
