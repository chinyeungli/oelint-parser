  "DESCRIPTION": "Tiny image capable of booting a device. The kernel includes \u001bthe Minimal RAM-based Initial Root Filesystem (initramfs), which finds the \u001bfirst 'init' program more efficiently. core-image-tiny-initramfs doesn't \u001bactually generate an image but rather generates boot and rootfs artifacts \u001bthat can subsequently be picked up by external image generation tools such as wic.",
