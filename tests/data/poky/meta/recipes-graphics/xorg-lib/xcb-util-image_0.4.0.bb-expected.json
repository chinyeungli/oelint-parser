  "SUMMARY": "XCB: The X protocol C binding utilities",
  "DESCRIPTION": "The xcb-util module provides a number of libraries which \u001bsit on top of libxcb, the core X protocol library, and some of the \u001bextension libraries. These experimental libraries provide convenience \u001bfunctions and interfaces which make the raw X protocol more usable. Some \u001bof the libraries also provide client-side code which is not strictly \u001bpart of the X protocol but which have traditionally been provided by \u001bXlib.",
