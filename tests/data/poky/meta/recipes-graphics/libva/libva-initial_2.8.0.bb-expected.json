  "SUMMARY": "Video Acceleration (VA) API for Linux",
  "DESCRIPTION": "Video Acceleration API (VA API) is a library (libVA) \u001band API specification which enables and provides access to graphics \u001bhardware (GPU) acceleration for video processing on Linux and UNIX \u001bbased operating systems. Accelerated processing includes video \u001bdecoding, video encoding, subpicture blending and rendering. The \u001bspecification was originally designed by Intel for its GMA (Graphics \u001bMedia Accelerator) series of GPU hardware, the API is however not \u001blimited to GPUs or Intel specific hardware, as other hardware and \u001bmanufacturers can also freely use this API for hardware accelerated \u001bvideo decoding.",
