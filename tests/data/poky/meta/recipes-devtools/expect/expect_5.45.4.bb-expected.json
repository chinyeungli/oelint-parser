  "SUMMARY": "tool for automating interactive applications according to a script",
  "DESCRIPTION": "Expect is a tool for automating interactive applications according to a script. \u001bFollowing the script, Expect knows what can be expected from a program and what \u001bthe correct response should be. Expect is also useful for testing these same \u001bapplications. And by adding Tk, you can also wrap interactive applications in \u001bX11 GUIs. An interpreted language provides branching and high-level control \u001bstructures to direct the dialogue. In addition, the user can take control and \u001binteract directly when desired, afterward returning control to the script. \u001b",
