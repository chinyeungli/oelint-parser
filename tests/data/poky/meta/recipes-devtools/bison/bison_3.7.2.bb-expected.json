  "SUMMARY": "GNU Project parser generator (yacc replacement)",
  "DESCRIPTION": "Bison is a general-purpose parser generator that converts an annotated context-free grammar into \u001ban LALR(1) or GLR parser for that grammar.  Bison is upward compatible with Yacc: all properly-written Yacc \u001bgrammars ought to work with Bison with no change. Anyone familiar with Yacc should be able to use Bison with \u001blittle trouble.",
