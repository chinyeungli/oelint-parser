  "DESCRIPTION": "ACPID is a completely flexible, totally extensible daemon for \u001bdelivering ACPI events. It listens on netlink interface (or on the \u001bdeprecated file /proc/acpi/event), and when an event occurs, executes programs \u001bto handle the event. The programs it executes are configured through a set of \u001bconfiguration files, which can be dropped into place by packages or by the \u001badmin.",
